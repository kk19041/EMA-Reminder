# EMA-Reminder

I am giving students reminders of the events they need to attend at the university each day, such as lectures and lab classes. I also provide weekly overviews of how well they have done at attending different sorts of events over the last week. The aim is to support students with ADHD and overseas students who often find it challenging to manage their time when they first attend university.
